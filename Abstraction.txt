Abstraction:

Abstraction is the Proces of the to Hideing internal Data/Internal Functionality & Tp provideing Sequrity for our code.

in Abstraction we have a 2types of class's.
1.Abstract Class
2.Interface Class


Abstract Class:
=>abstract is a Reserved keyword
Abstract class is a some Restricted class.
we cant create Object for any Abstract classs.

syntex:-

abstract class Ram
{

}

abstract Method:-
abstract method can only use in abstract class's.
it does not have any Body.
the body is Provided by Subclass(inherit)

syntex :

abstract class Ram
{

abstract void Task();
}
*** in abstract class we can write both types of Methods(Normal methods & abstract methods)


Interface Class:

interface is a class level of Reserved Keyword.
its only use for Designeing class(New Project).

syntex:

interface Ram
{
final static int a=50;
abstract void Task();
}

interface class, its contains only final static variables(Requirements) & Abstract methods.
in the methods are by default "public abstract".
exp : public abstract void Task();
in requirements variables are by default "public final static"
